# WireGuard Configuration Script

This script automates the process of setting up and managing WireGuard VPN users. It simplifies the configuration and deployment of WireGuard for your organization.

## Configuration

The script uses the following configuration variables:

- `WG_CONF`: Path to the WireGuard configuration file (`wg0.conf`).
- `USER_LIST`: Path to the text file containing the list of users.
- `CONFIG_DIR`: Directory where user configurations will be stored (individual files for each user).
- `IPADDR_MAP`: JSON file mapping usernames to IP addresses and keys.
- `SERVER_PUBLIC_KEY`: Public key of the WireGuard server (replace with your actual server's public key).
- `ENDPOINT`: Endpoint of the WireGuard server (IP and port).
- `DNS`: DNS servers to be used by the VPN clients.
- `SUBNET`: Subnet used for the VPN network.
- `CLIENT_ADDRESS_START`: Starting IP address for clients.

## Usage

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Ensure that WireGuard is installed on your system.
   - Run the script with root privileges (`sudo`).

2. **User List:**
   - Edit the `USER_LIST` file to include the usernames you want to configure.

3. **Running the Script:**
   - Execute the Python script:
     ```bash
     sudo ./wireguard_config_script.py
     ```

## How the Script Works

1. **Backup:**
   - The script creates a backup of the original `wg0.conf` if it doesn't exist.

2. **User Configuration:**
   - For each user in the `USER_LIST`:
     - Generates private and public keys.
     - Creates individual WireGuard configuration files.
     - Updates the `wg0.conf` with new user configurations.

3. **WireGuard Interface:**
   - The script applies the changes to the WireGuard interface.

## Generating Client Configurations

- After running the script, individual configuration files for each user will be created in the `CONFIG_DIR` directory.
- These files contain the necessary settings for each client, including private keys, IP addresses, and server details.

## Creating QR Codes

- If you want to generate QR codes for easy client setup, follow these steps:
  1. Install `qrencode` on your system (if not already installed).
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install qrencode
     ```
  2. Generate a QR code for a specific user's configuration file (e.g., `alice.conf`):
     ```bash
     qrencode -t ansiutf8 < /path_to_CONFIG_DIR/alice.conf
     ```
     This command will display the QR code in the terminal. Users can scan this code with their mobile devices to import the WireGuard configuration.

## Example Configuration

Below is an example of a client configuration file named `alice.conf` that would be generated for a user named Alice. This file includes all the necessary details that Alice would need to connect to the WireGuard VPN.

```ini
[Interface]
PrivateKey = <Alice's Private Key>
Address = 10.66.66.2/32
DNS = 1.1.1.1, 1.0.0.1

[Peer]
PublicKey = <Server's Public Key>
PresharedKey = <Alice's Preshared Key>
Endpoint = <Server's Endpoint IP>:<Server's Endpoint Port>
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0, ::/0
```

## IP Address Mapping (ipaddr-map.json)

The `ipaddr-map.json` file plays a crucial role in managing user configurations within the WireGuard VPN setup. Here's how it works:

1. **Purpose:**
   - The `ipaddr-map.json` file serves as a mapping between usernames and their associated IP addresses, private keys, and other relevant information.
   - It ensures that each user has a unique IP address within the VPN subnet.

2. **Structure:**
   - The file is in JSON format, making it easy to read and manipulate programmatically.
   - Each entry in the map corresponds to a user and contains the following fields:
     - `username`: The user's username (e.g., "alice").
     - `privateKey`: The user's private key generated by the script.
     - `publicKey`: The corresponding public key derived from the private key.
     - `presharedKey`: A pre-shared key used for secure communication.
     - `address`: The assigned IP address for the user (e.g., "10.66.66.2/32").

3. **Updating the Map:**
   - When a new user is added, the script generates their private and public keys.
   - It then updates the `ipaddr-map.json` with the user's details, including the assigned IP address.

4. **User Configuration Files:**
   - The script uses the information from the `ipaddr-map.json` to create individual configuration files for each user.
   - These files (e.g., `alice.conf`, `bob.conf`) contain the necessary settings for the WireGuard client.

5. **WireGuard Interface:**
   - The `wg0.conf` file (WireGuard server configuration) references the IP addresses from the `ipaddr-map.json`.
   - When the WireGuard interface is brought up, it uses these IP addresses to route traffic between the server and clients.

## Notes

- Keep the `ipaddr-map.json` secure, as it contains sensitive information.
- If you need to add or remove users, update the map accordingly.

Feel free to customize the script to fit your organization's requirements.
